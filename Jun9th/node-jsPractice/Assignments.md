# Database
Before you get started with the exercises, run the following script on your local database:

```
CREATE TABLE `car` (
  `car_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `model` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `make` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `color` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `price` INT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`car_id`));

insert into car (model, make, color, price) values ('Mazda6', 'Mazda', 'white', 30000);
insert into car (model, make, color, price) values ('Corvette', 'Chevy', 'red', 50400);
insert into car (model, make, color, price) values ('Mustang', 'Ford', 'blue', 33000);
insert into car (model, make, color, price) values ('Camaro', 'Chevy', 'green', 33000);
insert into car (model, make, color, price) values ('Bronco', 'Ford', 'black', 43000);
insert into car (model, make, color, price) values ('458', 'Ferrari', 'red', 250000);

There's no need to harden this endpoint (validation, etc).  Focus on getting the basic functionality built first.  We will harden these endpoints at the end.

Use the `MySqlProxy.js` approach for accessing data from the database.  Don't for get to create the `PromisePool.js` in your server directory.
